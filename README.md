##  Project Overview

The goal of this project is to automate the ML workflow using DevOps principles. The pipeline handles:

- Data ingestion and preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- CI pipeline with tests and linting
- CD pipeline with Docker build and optional deployment
- Serving the model via an API (Flask/FastAPI)

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions automates the following:

- **Install dependencies**
- **Run lint checks (`flake8`)**
- **Format check (`black`)**
- **Run unit tests (`pytest`)**

### Continuous Deployment (optional)

- **Build Docker image**
- **Push to DockerHub**
- **Deploy to a server or cloud (e.g., EC2, Render, etc.)**
